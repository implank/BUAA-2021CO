/*
 * This function reads .data symbol from INPUT and add them to the SYMTBL
 * Note that in order to distinguish in the symbol table whether a symbol
 * comes from the .data segment or the .text segment, we append a % to the
 * symbol name when adding the .data segment symbol. Since only underscores and
 * letters will appear in legal symbols, distinguishing them by adding % will
 * not cause a conflict between the new symbol and the symbol in the assembly file.
 *
 * Return value:
 * Return the number of bytes in the .data segment.

/* Adds a new symbol and its address to the SymbolTable pointed to by TABLE.
 * ADDR is given as the byte offset from the first instruction. The SymbolTable
 * must be able to resize itself as more elements are added.
 *
 * Note that NAME may point to a temporary array, so it is not safe to simply
 * store the NAME pointer. You must store a copy of the given string.
 *
 * If ADDR is not word-aligned, you should call addr_alignment_incorrect() and
 * return -1. If the table's mode is SYMTBL_UNIQUE_NAME and NAME already exists
 * in the table, you should call name_already_exists() and return -1. If memory
 * allocation fails, you should call allocation_failed().And alloction_failed()
 * will print error message and exit with error code 1.
 *
 * Otherwise, you should store the symbol name and address and return 0.

 * Convert lui instructions to machine code. Note that for the imm field of lui,

 * 0 on success, -1 otherwise.

 * Arguments:
 * opcode:     op segment in MIPS machine code
 * args:       args[0] is the $rt register, and args[1] can be either an imm field or 
 *             a .data segment label. The other cases are illegal and need not be considered
 * num_args:   length of args array
 * addr:       Address offset of the current instruction in the file
